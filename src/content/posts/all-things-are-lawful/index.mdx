_This post was originally a letter_

​​As you read, please keep the following in mind:

​​  

​​_What I’m not saying_ — you are in one camp or the other, if I appear to create unnecessary division or false dichotomies, please make a comment so I can clarify.

​​  

​​_What I’m not saying_ — there is not a time, place, or reason for opposing the civil magistrate. Rather, I’m asking if we are really at that point.

### ​​Should the following be granted

1.  ​​**The state is doing something illegal** i.e. overreaching their authority to dictate gatherings.

2.  ​​**The virus isn’t as serious** in the US as it has been in [Italy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-bergamo.html), Spain, and other countries.

3.  ​​**The medical community has erred** in their estimation of the efficacy of preventative measures, e.g. wearing masks, social distancing, etc.

​​_Note: these are granted for the sake of argument — I am not endorsing these views._

### ​​And considering the following facts

1.  ​​Some people in our church believe the state is operating within their sphere of authority.

2.  ​​[Over 90,000 people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) in the US alone have died from Coronavirus.

3.  ​​Some people in our church believe preventative measures to be in keeping with Jesus’ [commandment to love one another](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+13%3A31-35&version=ESV).

​​_Note: if you do not agree with these facts as presented, please grant them for the sake of argument._

​​  

​​I’m confident that regardless of political leanings and where on the spectrum you are in the current issue — as Christians we are in agreement in regards to our operating principles, our liberty in Christ, and the importance of self-examination.

### ​​What are our operating principles?

1.  ​​God’s law — love God, love your neighbor

1.  ​​[How do we love God?](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14&version=ESV)

2.  ​​[What is true, undefiled religion?](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1&version=ESV)

### ​​Love or liberty?

*   ​​‘All things are lawful,’ but not all things are helpful. ‘All things are lawful,’ but not all things build up. Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.

*   ​​1 Corinthians 10:23-24

​​  

*   ​​We have an opportunity — to submit to lawful authority, to be obedient and faithful, powerful witnesses of Christian sacrifice.[³](/doc/Church-State--A0P_mjBiap7f8VEw2ym6KEgIAg-DfYRyxvA6q73SL6JcxRzz#:uid=957544596841236461145706&h2=References) 

### ​​Are we bearing the fruits of the Spirit?

*   ​​…love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control…

*   ​​Galatians 5:22-23

### ​​How will our hearts be weighed?

*   ​​Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,

*   ​​ but the Lord weighs the heart.

*   ​​Proverbs 21:2

## ​​What is our witness?

1.  ​​Is our “suffering” producing [endurance, character, and hope?](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5&version=ESV)

2.  ​​Are we operating effectively within our spheres of influence and control, in order to grow them and glorify God?

3.  ​​Or are we violating 3rd commandment, by taking the name of Christ in vain and causing it to be defamed?

​​  

*   ​​…we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope…

*   ​​Romans 5:3-4

​​  

*   ​​Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good. 

*   ​​1 Peter 4:19

## ​​Are we in greater danger of violating the 3rd and 5th commandments before the 4th?

1.  ​​Are we glorifying God’s name?

2.  ​​Are we honoring the civil magistrate?

3.  ​​Is not physically gathering together for worship a violation of the Sabbath? _See_ [_Matthew 4_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4&version=ESV)

​​  

*   ​​It is the duty of people to pray for magistrates, to honour their persons, to pay them tribute or other dues, to obey their lawful commands and to be subject to their authority, for conscience’ sake. Infidelity, or difference in religion, doth not make void the magistrates’ just and legal authority, nor free the people from their due obedience to them

*   ​​[Westminster Confession Chapter 23, Article 4](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Confession_of_Faith_of_the_Assembly_of_Divines_at_Westminster#Chapter_23)

## ​​To what extent are we undermining our own pro-life stance?

​​_What I’m not saying_ — if you want to re-open you aren’t pro-life. 

​​  

​​_What I am saying_ — think very carefully about how our actions, and the fallout from those actions will be perceived by the world that is watching and waiting for the church to stumble.

​​  

​​With all the emphasis and importance being placed on “reopening” the economy — what is the message we’re sending to vulnerable people who might be at best worried and anxious, and at worst be put at increased risk?

## ​​Are we taking our Christian liberty as seriously as we ought?

​​Our freedom was paid for dearly — [as Christians](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+6&version=ESV) and [as Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war) — with that liberty comes great responsibility. 

​​  

​​Are we considering the great sacrifice that has been made on our behalf — and looking for ways, even in the small, and ordinary — to follow that example of sacrifice?

​​  

​​And — until a legitimate body of authority that we submit to (in our case, the OPC General Assembly?) says that what the US government is doing is illegal — are we willing to be censured by the church and civil magistrate?

​​  

*   ​​And because the powers which God hath ordained, and the liberty which Christ hath purchased, are not intended by God to destroy, but mutually to uphold and preserve one another; they who, upon pretence of Christian liberty, **shall oppose any lawful power**, or the **lawful exercise of it**, whether it be **civil or ecclesiastical**, **resist the ordinance of God**. And, **for their publishing of such opinions**, or **maintaining of such practices**, as are contrary to the light of nature, or to the known principles of Christianity, whether concerning faith, worship, or conversation; or, to the power of godliness; or, such erroneous opinions or practices, as either in their own nature, **or in the manner of publishing or maintaining them**, **are destructive to the external peace and order which Christ hath established in the Church, they may lawfully be called to account, and proceeded against by the censures of the Church**, and by the power of the civil magistrate.

*   ​​[Westminster Confession Chapter 20, Article 4](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Confession_of_Faith_of_the_Assembly_of_Divines_at_Westminster#Chapter_20)

​​  

​​It’s a lengthy passage — but please read it again.

​​  

*   ​​**…in the manner of publishing or maintaining them, are destructive to the external peace and order which Christ has established in the Church, they may lawfully be called to account…**

​​  

​​The Confession goes out of its way to address _how_ one goes about using ones liberty — are we being as circumspect?

​​  

​​If I can emphasize again — **_I am not saying_** there isn’t a time and place for “here I stand I can do no other”, but even Martin Luther took at least 4 years to get there.

## ​​How could this be seen as a race issue?

​​_This is not an accusation of racism, such claims are counterproductive, only to highlight the effects of the_ [_institutional racism_](https://www.thoughtco.com/examples-of-institutional-racism-in-the-u-s-2834624) _(for_ _sake of argument — the fact that minorities disproportionately experience negative externalities) that still plagues our country._

​​  

1.  ​​Minorities are [far more likely](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793) to be subject to police brutality — [that hasn’t changed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/nyregion/nypd-social-distancing-race-coronavirus.html) because of Covid.

2.  ​​The effects of the pre-existing structural inequality have become more serious and deadly:

​​  

*   ​​For many public health experts, the reasons behind the disparities are not difficult to explain, the result of longstanding structural inequalities. At a time when the authorities have advocated staying home as the best way to avoid the virus, black Americans disproportionately belong to part of the work force that does not have the luxury of working from home, experts said. That places them at high risk for contracting the highly infectious disease in transit or at work.[⁹](/doc/Church-State--A0SXrS6h~xatuoOK7oHLF0sdAg-DfYRyxvA6q73SL6JcxRzz#:uid=957544596841236461145706&h2=References-&-Further-Reading)

​​  

​​Some could see social media posts deriding government officials for taking measures to protect the public, and protesting for their right to be called “essential workers” to be insensitive at best, and downright insulting at worst. 

​​  

​​Where is the outcry when there are [actual, far more serious](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855611039/shooting-of-unarmed-black-woman-in-kentucky-raises-a-lot-of-questions) [travesties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Ahmaud_Arbery)?

​​  

​​I say these things not as a guilt-trip — but rather to remind that what we don’t say is often more important than what we do say. 

## ​​How comfortable are we with the worst possible outcome?

1.  ​​If we open prematurely, against the law and general medical advice, and someone dies — are you comfortable living with that on your conscience?

2.  ​​Do we need [to experience the tail-end consequences of getting hit](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-three-sides-of-risk/) or can we be wise, apply biblical principles, and [learn some lessons from history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#Deadly_second_wave)?

​​  

*   ​​The prudent sees danger and hides himself,

*   ​​ but the simple go on and suffer for it.

*   ​​Proverbs 22:3

​​  

​​This might beg the question — when is it safe to re-open? Who do we trust to make that decision? 

​​  

​​[Given the stakes](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=Coronavirus+deaths), I’m surprised at the level of bravado displayed by some. If even people in the medical community aren’t able to come to a consensus, shouldn’t we err on the side of caution?

## ​​What is the opportunity cost?

1.  ​​Our time and energy are finite resources.

2.  ​​Time is a zero-sum game — every hour spent debating is an hour we don’t spend [doing kingdom work](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25&version=ESV).

3.  ​​Are we measuring and evaluating the time and resources we invest to ensure optimal returns?

​​  

​​_What is the ratio of time spent doing high-impact, high-value work on things we can immediately control versus things that, at best, we influence and worst only be concerned and frustrated by._

## ​​What are we doing with our talents?

​​_At the start of the shutdown, there was a toxic thread in tech — basically people with few responsibilities outside of their day-to-day work were suggesting that with all this_ _“free_ _time” we should be doing side projects, etc. This is not what I’m saying._

​​  

​​What I’m also not saying is that the session needs to be busier.

​​  

​​_What I am saying_ — encourage those around you to seriously consider:

​​  

​​**We have been given much** — time, money, comfort — **_are we putting that excess to good use?_**

​​  

*   ​​Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.

*   ​​Luke 12: 48

## ​​Are our efforts focused on what the Bible emphasizes?

​​_What I’m not saying_ — there isn’t a time and place for discussion on biblical worship.

​​  

​​_What I am saying_ — given the urgency of the current situation, what should our priorities be?

​​  

1.  ​​Jesus’ life was one of self-sacrifice and humility — how are we being Christ-like?

1.  ​​[The theology of the cross is counter to the theology of glory](http://bookofconcord.org/heidelberg.php#21)

2.  ​​The Bible is replete with directives to care for the poor, weak, and vulnerable — are we doing that to the best of our abilities?

​​  

*   ​​[…though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all…](http://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+9/)

​​  

*   ​​…if the death of Christ is mysteriously a blessing, then any evil that the believer experiences can be a blessing too.[²](/doc/Church-State--A0P_mjBiap7f8VEw2ym6KEgIAg-DfYRyxvA6q73SL6JcxRzz#:uid=957544596841236461145706&h2=References)

​​  

## ​​Specific Concerns

​​Considering the questions I’ve outlined above, I’d like to share the following concerns — I know these are biased and fallible — I don’t necessarily expect an explicit response, I’m merely hoping they contribute meaningfully to the dialog and bring more questions to your minds.

​​  

1.  ​​From my limited perspective, it seems like there is a disproportionate amount of effort put into reopening church vs. serving people in our church and community.

2.  ​​From what I see and hear, it feels like a lot of the comparisons are comparing an extreme view to a centrist view — instead of to the opposite extremes. 

3.  ​​In my opinion — it feels like a lot of people are focusing on things that we can’t immediately and directly control, which results in frustration. What can we do to share the work being done that is within our current sphere? At the very least to share each other’s burdens.

4.  ​​The current climate feels very pharisaical — in our rush to obey the letter of one law, it feels like we are neglecting the spirit of the whole law. 

5.  ​​In my estimation — best case scenario:

1.  ​​Overblown panic around the virus we all just spent the last 8 weeks isolating for no reason

2.  ​​If we continue on our current path, the church could be seen as privileged, legalistic people more concerned about their individual rights and [comfort](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A17&version=ESV) 

3.  ​​What actions could we take that would make b an impossibly ridiculous perspective?

6.  ​​I can only imagine the worst case scenario:

1.  ​​This is only the first wave — any time we could have bought ourselves by facing reality and preparing, caring for the most vulnerable in our church and communities, being lights and witnesses, has been squandered by 8 weeks of futile conversation and inaction (I’m saying this is a perception — not necessarily my perception — to what degree could this perception be true?)

2.  ​​The government’s classification of the western evangelical church as non-essential is warranted. I am differentiating between the western evangelical church and the universal, invisible church — the former seems to be shrinking, while the latter will only grow to take over the world.

7.  ​​The following are not in keeping with my understanding of the spirit with which the session makes decisions:

1.  ​​**Emphasizing vote totals** — while transparency is valuable, it could be perceived as groaning publicly about, “We were so close!” This could be interpreted as counterproductive and dishonoring to the group’s consensus; it’s our unique responsibility to deliver our message effectively.

2.  ​​**Publicly disagreeing with a decision the session has made** — by all means continue to strengthen your argument, however sharing thoughts and ideas contrary to the decision in a public forum _(despite_ _it being well within our rights)_ makes people feel like it’s similarly appropriate to air grievances privately or publicly — [see WC 20.4](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Church-State-A0SXrS6hxatuoOK7oHLF0sdAg-DfYRyxvA6q73SL6JcxRzz#:uid=778610313825135823874551&h2=Are-we-taking-our-Christian-li)

​​  

## ​​Conclusion

​​Quite frankly, removing my filter and speaking from my desperately wicked heart, I’m embarrassed and ashamed by what I’ve seen scrolling through social media. 

​​  

​​If my unbelieving coworkers in Spain, Italy, or China — or for that matter even here in the US — saw what we’re doing with the incredible amount of privilege (freedom of movement, expansive homes, yards, etc) that we have, they would find us incredibly wanting.

​​  

*   ​​Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers. Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, and their talk will spread like gangrene.

*   ​​2 Timothy 2: 14-17

​​  


### ​​1\. Take a digital media fast for two weeks

​​Abstain from engaging with and consuming social media, news media, television, etc. ​​  

​​Spend that time in God’s word, reach out to others, exercise, call your mom, things you're probably already doing — just do it more so, and without the distraction of digital media.

### ​​2\. Obey the Civil Magistrate until you can come to unanimous agreement to do otherwise

​​As the volume and temperature of the discussion has shown, this is a very weighty matter. As Americans, it seems at times we feel we are obligated to disobey the magistrate at the slightest miscue. 

​​I have heard Pastor Paul in the past on the topic of civil disobedience — specifically in the context of the American Revolution — that a prerequisite for disobeying the government is having an alternative unified form of government. And I don’t believe we have that.

*   ​​But in that obedience which we have shown to be due the authority of rulers, we are always to make this exception, indeed, to observe it as primary, that such obedience is never to lead us away from obedience to him, to whose will the desires of all kings ought to be subject, to whose decrees all their commands ought to yield, to whose majesty their scepters ought to be submitted. And how absurd would it be that in satisfying men you should incur the displeasure of him for whose sake you obey men themselves! The Lord, therefore, is the King of Kings, who, when his sacred mouth, must alone be heard, before all and above all men; next to him we are subject to those men who are in authority over us, but only in him. If they command anything against him, let it go unesteemed. 

*   ​​—John Calvin
