To batch create a bunch of folders based on the name of mdx files (change file extention if you want to use on a different type of file): 

``` sh
for x in ./*.mdx; do
  mkdir "${x%.*}" && mv "$x" "${x%.*}"
done
```

## Rename files to `index.mdx`

To rename all of the aforementioned mdx files to 'index.mdx', go up one level `cd ..` and use:

``` sh
find ./posts/ -iname '*.mdx' -execdir mv -i '{}' index.mdx \;
```

## Create `images` subfolder

To create `images` subfolders in all of the post subfolders, run:

``` sh
for dir in */; do mkdir -- "$dir/images"; done
```
