Today my grandpa went to sleep for the last time. 

This past September we celebrated his 90th birthday. 



> I finally found Honoluluâ€™s Corkscrew Lane in in one of my old maps. Corkscrew Lane disappeared during construction of the downtown end of southbound Pali Highway in the early 1960s. This picture is posted for my Flickr friend Bobby Command who made me aware of the Corkscrew neighborhood which I had never heard of. The scan is from a vintage HRT (Honolulu Rapid Transit) map guide dated October 1952.

> - Corkscrew Lane between Kukui Street and Fort Street

> - 1927 Central Intermediate School is in the block north of Corkscrew Lane

> - 1914 St. Peters Episcopal Church is in the block across Queen Emma Street

> - The dotted red lines are the gas and diesel bus routes and the solid red lines are the electric trolley coach routes
