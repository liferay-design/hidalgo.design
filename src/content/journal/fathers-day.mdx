title: "Father's Day"

I'm not sure if it's the global pandemic, the pulling back of the racist curtain here in the US, or maybe lack of sleep &mdash; but for whatever reaosn I was very pensive today.

Thinking about my friends who've recently had miscarriages, my friends struggling to get pregnant, my friends who have lost a child, my friends who have lost their dads, my friends who never really had fathers.

My prayer is Heavenly Father &mdash; you are all knowing and all powerful &mdash; lift up those who mourn, let them be filled and comforted by you.

> Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
>
> _Matthew 10:29—31_

My prayer is also for those who are unable to be with their kids, by their own choice or by someone else's — that you would be with them, comfort and be a father to those children, raise up men in their lives who can serve them in that way.

For men whose partners have terminated pregnancies &mdash; denying them the priviledge of being a father. If that was done against their will, that you would give them solace and consolation. For those who were complicit in denying themselves fatherhood &mdash; that you would never let them rest, until they find forgiveness in you, Lord. Help your church to be sensitive, especially to these men.

> O Lord, you hear the desire of the afflicted;
>     you will strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear
> to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed,
>     so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.
>
> _Psalm 10:17-18_
