> Juan I was just starting to understand you through your Kentucky-Spanish accent! And now, sadly, that oddly specific skill will be gathering dust until our paths cross again. Joking aside, thanks for everything man. You always knew just the right thing to ask to activate and unlock hidden potential in myself. Your leadership style taught me to recognize and seize opportunity. I will always appreciate you for that and hope to take that with me throughout my career. I’m sad that you will no longer be with us at Liferay, but wish you and your family the very best that life can offer. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me for anything professional or personal. Don’t be a stranger, SIR!

> Joining the Design team has been an incredible experience. Something that I noticed immediately is the openness and support people from every management level show. Thank you for creating a thriving team! I wish you all the best for this next chapter, and just know all the hard work put into Liferay has truly made a difference.

> Juan, as I told before, your farewell message really caught me by surprise! When I joined Liferay I felt a warm welcome and was excited being part of this incredible and talented team. Unfortunately, I had less interaction with you than I would have wished. Nevertheless, I want you to know that I was very inspired by your leadership and by the department’s culture (and structure). Not every design org has the chance to have a VP like you. It is sad to see you leave but I wish you all the best in your new path and all the joy in your life. Thank you for this unique opportunity. Thank you, Sir, for all the work you leave behind in our department. May your legacy be our guiding light for the road ahead!

>Professionally, you taught me so much — I’m not sure I will ever reach the level of confidence you have in me — regardless, I’m so thankful for all you have taught me. Personally — it’s hard to find a better friend than you, and I’m glad that even though our professional paths are diverging, our friendship will continue to grow.

> Juan, thanks for always believing in me. From wanting to invest in me through UX and research to supporting me in the things I wanted to do and learn, even though I don’t think I always made the best decisions for myself. I know you have a huge heart for design and a vision for what it could look like at Liferay and to achieve that vision, you had to make tough changes at times. I hope you can take all that you’ve gained from Liferay into your next adventure and help others grow. Aside from work things, my favorite parts have always been the non-work things. I’ll never forget getting blocked by you. I’ll never forget getting to coach your boys. I’ll never forget when you’d ask me about my health or talking about “Brook Lopez’s mother.” I hope you’ll always be able to be personable and that all the other things will be secondary. Blessings in your next journey.

Sadly due to the circumstances we only had the chance to meet once in the office. I really appreciate your holistic design view and your great expertise in so many areas. I wish you all the best for your upcoming journey and great blessings to you and your family.

> Hi Juan! Goodbyes are always sad, but I would like to keep in the heart all the good you leave behind. Thanks for the amazing Design Team you had built here in Liferay, full of very talented people and great human beings. Thanks for your vision, your direction and for every advice you gave us, in order to make us better designers. “Change is the only constant in life”, and you are brave to face it with pride. Wish you all the best in this new direction. Big Hug from Madrid!

> I can’t list the numerous things I’ve learned at work from you. Thanks to all your strategic thinking, how you teached us to build a good team with a high impact. Everything changed here with you. On the personal side… thanks for all the weekly meetings, 5 years in the long distance, but feeling I have you in the seat next to me. Thanks for taking me to all kinds of restaurants in LA, in my mind will always be the Ramen near the office, Lucille’s, the lobster, and the canadian-indian restaurants. You made this entire experience incredible. Thanks amigo!

I hope our paths cross again in the near future. I wish you all the best always. Please keep in touch! mer

> When I received the offer to join Liferay I was so thrilled because when I met you and the team at the Figma event, I knew I would learn a lot from the passionate and talented designers you’ve assembled. Being a part of Liferay Design is an experience I will always treasure as I have grown and learned so much more than I imagined thanks to your leadership and what you’ve built over the years. Most importantly, you’ve established a culture for each designer to be appreciated and cared for, which many organizations can only dream about. Thank you for each word of wisdom over the years. I hope I can be as inspirational and empowering to those around me as you have been for me. Looking forward to our next catch up together!
